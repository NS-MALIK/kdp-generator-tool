                    <p>I am a results-driven **Full Stack Hybrid App Developer** and **Security Analyst** with over 4 years of professional experience in the IT industry. My expertise lies at the critical intersection of development and cybersecurity—a true DevSecOps approach. I specialize in building robust, performant hybrid mobile applications while proactively ensuring their security against modern threats.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Development Expertise</h3>
                    <p>As a seasoned Hybrid Mobile App Developer, I architect and deliver end-to-end, high-quality full-stack applications for both Android and iOS platforms. I leverage the power of React Native and <strong>Python</strong> to create seamless, user-friendly experiences for global clients. My focus is on efficient, scalable code delivery throughout the entire software development lifecycle.</p>

                    <h3>Cybersecurity & Offensive Security Focus</h3>
                    <p>My background includes dedicated specialization in Offensive Security and Penetration Testing. I adopt a 'Red Team' mindset to identify, exploit, and remediate vulnerabilities in mobile and web applications before they can be leveraged by attackers. This unique perspective enhances my role as a Security Analyst, where I implement secure coding best practices, perform comprehensive threat modeling, and integrate security controls directly into the development pipeline. My commitment is to deliver high-quality code that is secure by design.</p>
